This is my first game for [Sandbox](https://sbox.facepunch.com). I'm basing it on the top
down template for a multiplayer game about making a run for the oranges.

Basically, you run around collecting oranges and have to drop them somewhere near the spawn
point. You can only carry a maximum amount of oranges at a given time and as you carry more
you slow down so you need to balance distance, carry count and return trips to get the most.

On top of this, on random locations orange boxes will spawn giving you a lot of oranges.

The player that collects the most oranges in a minute or two wins.

This is the base game that I want to develop, I'm thinking about making modifiers afterwards
to add game mechanics to mess with the player (hehe) and make the game more fun.
